                    <p>I was accepted to Saint Anselm College as an engineering major in the winter of 2017. During my final semester at Cheverus High School in Portland, Maine, I realized I had a passion for coding during my AP Computer Science class where I was learning Java. Once I arrived on campus at St. A's, I switched my major to Computer Science with Mathematics. In my third year, I added a Cyber Criminology minor and a Web Design minor to my curriculum. Finally, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science with Mathematics. But I didn't just go to class every day.</p><br>

                    <p>During my time at St. A's, I did more than just attend class and study (I did some of that too though). I was active around campus right from the beginning of my first year. I got an on-campus job at the IT Help Desk where I solved problems over the phone, helped walk-ins, and went to classrooms to help professors with active issues during their class time. I kept this job for all four years at St. A's, where in my second year I was promoted by my superiors and a vote by my peers to be the Help Desk Manager, then again in my third year I was promoted to Help Desk Director, the highest student position, by the same process. With these titles came responsibilities like lead student training, creating the student schedule for the entire semester, and be the voice between the staff technicians and students.</p><br>
                    <p>I also joined the Jazz Band where I played alto saxophone. We practiced once every week on Thursday nights and had occasional gigs both on and off campus. My dedication, desire to be involved, and leadership for the younger students led me to be appointed by my peers as the Secretary in my fourth year in the band. This put me in charge of creating setlists, schedules, and leading our weekly practices.</p><br>
                    <p>Finally, I played for the Men's Club Rugby team where I was a proud member for all four years, though our final season was cancelled due to Covid-19. The club rugby team practiced twice a week during the fall and spring seasons, and had games and tournaments on the weekends. During my third year, I was appointed team President, where I led practices with our coach, worked with the Student Government Association to get funds for our season and sign us up for volunteering opportunities around the local Saint Anselm area, and worked with other teams in our area to set schedules for matches.</p><br>
